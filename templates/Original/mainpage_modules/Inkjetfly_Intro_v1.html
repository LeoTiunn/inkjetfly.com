supply without changing ink cartridges. The Inkjetfly G5 CISS simply

  <li>Compared to other similar products on the US market, Inkjetfly G5
Continuous Ink Supply System is two generations ahead. Its unique
design eases ink replenishment. The high quality inks provide vivid
colors and clog-free print head. CISS can be installed in minutes at
home, which can save your time, money, and wear and tear on your
printers. CISS also does not need any permanent modification to the
printer, which means no voiding in warranties.</li>
  <li>You don&rsquo;t have to purchase the disposable ink cartridge
frequently, and it does not require any contacts to the printer head.
The CISS prevents dust from entering the ink print head and extends its
service life. Its large ink capacity helps businesses to reduce
printing costs more than 90%, while the high quality ink produces
accurate colors and does not clog print heads.</li>
  <li>Unlike some of the cheap ink supplies on the market that have
either serious color problem or fade over time, the print quality of
the Inkjetfly G5 inks is guaranteed to be comparable to the original
ink.</li>
  <li>Inkjetfly offers 1 year limited warranty on the product.</li>
